# Pokémon Red and Blue -- Nuzlocke Edition [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

This is a fork of the [**Pokémon Red/Blue**][pokered] dissassembly. The goal of this project is to add a small subset of features for Red/Blue [**Nuzlocke challenges**][nuzlocke].

The intention of this project is to change as little as is required to enable features supporting a Nuzlocke (and maybe a couple of quality of life features, such as running shoes).

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
